We're trying to make a winter wonderland. It's snowing but that's about it. Let's make this a little more festive.

## To Run

Much like any other Node project

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Steps

### 1. Make the Enviroment
Navigate to Sketch.js and use the rect() and fill() functions to draw the ground for our winter wonderland.

Next find the `background` function and adjust the RGB values accordingly to make something that better represents a sky

### 2. Create the Snowman Class
Navigate to Snowman.js and use the ellipse() fill() and line() functions to create a Snowman class so we can create multiple snowmen

#### 2.5 Adding in Snowmen
In your `draw` function in sketch.js you need to create a new instance of each snowman you want to add with the following syntax:
```
let snowman = new Snowman(x, y);
```
This way we can add multiple snowmen into our winter wonderland.

### 3. Add some music
Download your favorite mp3 file and play some holiday cheer.

### 4. Remix
Make your own twist too this
